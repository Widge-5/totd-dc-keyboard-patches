# The Typing of the Dead (Dreamcast) ‚Äì European Keyboard Compatibility Patches

## Overview
These patches improve compatibility with **UK** and **German** keyboard layouts when playing the **USA version (v1.004 GDI)** of *The Typing of the Dead* on the Sega Dreamcast.

## Background
*The Typing of the Dead* was officially released on Dreamcast in **Japan** and **North America**, but never in Europe. As a result, the game was only designed to work correctly with keyboard layouts for those regions.

When using a European keyboard, many keys may be mismapped or unresponsive‚Äîespecially special characters and punctuation. This can make gameplay difficult or frustrating.

## What These Patches Do
These patches modify the game‚Äôs internal keyboard mapping tables to better match common European keyboard layouts, specifically:

- **UK (British)** layout  
- **German (QWERTZ)** layout

This allows for more accurate and familiar key input when using these keyboards, hopefully improving usability and accessibility.

## üîß Patch Details

### UK Layout Patch Notes
- Patch filename : `Typing of the Dead, The - UK Keyboard.dcp`
- The main game is mostly playable with a UK keyboard even without the patch, as there are relatively few layout differences. However, **some special characters in the Training games may be difficult to input** without it, making the patch especially helpful in those cases.
- The **UK `#` key** (located above the right Shift key and to the left of the Enter key) does **not exist on US keyboards**, and although it has been mapped in the patch, it remains **non-functional in-game**. As a workaround, the `#` symbol is also kept on **`Shift+3`**, and the **`¬£` symbol has been omitted**, as it is unlikely to be needed during gameplay.

### German Layout Patch Notes
- Patch filename : `Typing of the Dead, The - DE Keyboard.dcp`
- **German-specific characters such as √Ñ, √ñ, √ú, and √ü do not function in the game**, even when mapped. These have been substituted with their non-accented equivalents (A, O, U), and √ü is omitted entirely.
- The `=` key does not function in its standard German position. This may be due to the game expecting it **not to be used with Shift**, but that is speculation and the exact reason is unknown.
- **All required keys for gameplay are patched**, with one exception: **the German `#`/`'` key (‚ÄúHash"/"Apostrophe‚Äù)** does **not exist on US keyboards**, and while the patch attempts to map those characters to it, the key remains **non-functional in-game**. As a workaround, `#` is kept on **`Shift+3`**, and the **apostrophe `'` is moved to the key left of Backspace**, which is known to work reliably, but may be unfamiliar to you.  On a recommendation I also mapped apostrophe `'` to `Shift+√§` (just one key to the left), as it is similar to the intended location and may be helpful for muscle-memory.
